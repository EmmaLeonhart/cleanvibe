# cleanvibe — Work Queue

**This file is a queue, not a state snapshot.** Finished work lives in `devlog.md` (dated entries) and `git log`; longer-horizon ideas live in `todo.md`. **When an item is done, delete it from this file AND append a dated entry to `devlog.md` in the same commit, then push.** Never tick a box in place. See the `queue-driven-workflow` skill (`.claude/skills/queue-driven-workflow/SKILL.md`).

## Active

**Goal (Emma, 2026-10-03):** get a paper out fast, for arXiv endorser rights. A
clawRxiv paper that reviews well counts as good enough for arXiv. The paper is
about cleanvibe, lives at cleanvibe.emmaleonhart.com/paper, and CI posts it to
clawRxiv. Paper items come first.

1. **Publish the paper at cleanvibe.emmaleonhart.com/paper** (`pages/paper/`;
   the site is public). The note is posted (clawRxiv 2610.02895, v8).
   Ready, uncommitted, in gitignored `scratch/`: `note_to_page.py` +
   `paper_template.html` render `claw4s/note.md` into a site-styled page,
   and the v8 PDF is built. **BLOCKED-ON-USER-ACTION (Emma):** the
   auto-mode classifier refused writing the private repo's note into the
   public `pages/` (2026-10-04, "Out-of-Place Publication"). Unblock: Emma
   says to publish it (or allows the write), then
   `python scratch/note_to_page.py <ai-context-research>/claw4s/note.md pages/paper/index.html`,
   copy the built `main.pdf` to `pages/paper/note.pdf`, link it from the
   home page, push.
2. **NEEDS-DECISION (Emma), do not start until she says go:** merging private
   repos into public cleanvibe can't be undone.
   **Merge the paper repos in as subtrees under `subtrees/`**, with history:
   `replication_skill`, then `deleuze-claw4S` and `clawrxiv_clone` (both
   private: run a secrets check on their full history first and stop if
   anything turns up). Move `helping-with-arxiv/` to `subtrees/` and delete its
   boilerplate `queue.md`.
3. **Quatrix arXiv submission:** BLOCKED-ON-USER-ACTION. The package is built;
   it is waiting on the author's approval of the metadata abstract.

**Not in this queue:** `Documents/GitHub/Should_be_submodules/` (INBE,
agentic-erp, emmaleonhart.com, topaz_buiness_plan). Not cleanvibe's; Emma,
2026-10-03, sent each to its own parent as a subtree under `subtrees/`:
agentic-erp and topaz_buiness_plan → the business repo
(`mental-health-discussion`, done and pushed); emmaleonhart.com →
`narrative_identity` (merged in a scratch clone, push blocked by the auto-mode
classifier: BLOCKED-ON-USER-ACTION); INBE → `genealogy`, a submodule of
ontology-harness (done and pushed; ontology-harness's pointer to genealogy not
bumped).
