# cleanvibe — Work Queue

**This file is a queue, not a state snapshot.** Finished work lives in `devlog.md` (dated entries) and `git log`; longer-horizon ideas live in `todo.md`. **When an item is done, delete it from this file AND append a dated entry to `devlog.md` in the same commit, then push.** Never tick a box in place. See the `queue-driven-workflow` skill (`.claude/skills/queue-driven-workflow/SKILL.md`).

**Hourly status-report cron.** This queue is being worked as extensive work: the closing two items are pinned at the tail in `## Always last` (ensure the hourly cron is running + run an end-of-session summary), per `CLAUDE.md` § "Hourly status-report cron for extensive work". A fresh session starts the cron up front; a re-fill's first item kills it; planning mode disables it.

## Active

From Emma's 2026-09-26 AskUserQuestion answers. **Strict order, as she listed it:** the CLAUDE.md section first, then refresh → doctor → release. Remote Control (her answer to a separate question) goes just before the release so it ships in it. Raw `.jsonl` logs stay committed (no change). The general-purpose rework comes later today and is out of scope here.

1. **Release v1.18.0.** Nothing after v1.18.0 has been released, so everything done today ships in it; no separate 1.19.0. When CI is green: `gh release create v1.18.0` with notes from the devlog, then confirm `publish.yml` pushes it to PyPI.

## Always last — restart the hourly cron and summarize

**These two items stay pinned to the tail of this queue** — below every work item above. They are the closing half of the hourly-status-report lifecycle in `CLAUDE.md` § "Hourly status-report cron for extensive work":

A. **Ensure the hourly status-report cron is running** — start it if this session never did, restart it if a planning burst / queue re-fill killed it (`CronCreate`, every hour on the hour, with a status report).
B. **Run the status-report action once more, independently** — an end-of-session summary of everything that happened this session.
